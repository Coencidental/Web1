          <h1>Hello there.</h1>
          <hr><br>
          <p>There are a million and one ways that I could start writing here, and when composing everything, they're all equally appealing in one way or another.  Regardless, I'm going to just dive in and hope for the best.</p><br><p>It's a pleasure to meet you, and to share this with you.</p><br>

          <p>My name is Coen Drexler, and of all the things I could say about myself in a document that could all too easily become an overladen mess of cliches, the only statement I feel important enough to undertone my introduction with is that <strong>creativity and it's application through skills <em>defines</em> my validation of work.</strong></p><br>

          <br><hr><br><br>

          <p>I once heard a simple enough idea that once I had lingered on it for a while, completely changed my perception of my own enjoyment of creative pursuits.  The idea was presented in a video by a  YouTube blacksmith, discussing getting into the art of making knives, and he said:</p><br>

          <p class="blockquote"><em><strong>"In school, we are taught that to make money, we work.  This is true to an extent, however to view it in this way is entirely limiting.  We should instead be taught that to make money, we need to find a way through skill to offer value to the world.  If one can find a way to provide value, genuine value, then payment is never hard to find.  Focus on skills, and using them to offer something tangibly valuable to the world."</strong></em></p><br>

          <div class="imagediv">
            <img src="capture.png" class="image1">
          </div>

          <p>Until I'd heard it in a way that made sense to me, it wasn't something I'd concluded myself.  Investing my first few years of adult life into casual, unrewarding and unstimulating work (for someone like me who is determined to offer something more creative, to create with inspiration) left me with a sense of crushing doubt, especially after my first career attempt (becoming an electrician) turned out to only inform me I'm colourblind, an issue in that industry.
